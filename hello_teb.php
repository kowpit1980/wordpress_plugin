	We all came out to Montreux
	On the Lake Geneva shoreline
	To make records with a mobile
	We didn't have much time
	Frank Zappa and the Mothers
	Were at the best place around
	But some stupid with a flare gun
	Burned the place to the ground
	Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
	Smoke on the water
	They burned down the gambling house
	It died with an awful sound
	Funky Claude was running in and out
	Pulling kids out the ground
	When it all was over
	We had to find another place
	But Swiss time was running out
	It seemed that we would lose the race
	Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
	Smoke on the water
	We ended up at the Grand hotel
	It wasâ€¦;";
